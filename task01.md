# Task 1 - completed

The task is to rewrite from the ground up the function `getCss` from legacy code.

The function converts a js object to plain CSS as described in [translation.md](./doc/translation.md).

The new code should be in TypeScript, should be covered by unit tests.

The legacy code, for reference, is in [js2css.js](./legacy-code/js2css.js) and dependent imports.

The old code should not be used, it is only for reference.

The new code should be in src/lib folder, it should be a set of well structured modules. It should not be a single huge file with hundreds of lines of code.

The configuration part mentioned in [translation.md](./doc/translation.md) is not relevant now. To understand config parameters, example values are provided in comment in the legacy code.
